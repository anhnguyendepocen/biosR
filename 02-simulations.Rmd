# Simulations

In this chapter you'll learn how to conduct a simulation study. The word _simulation_ gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting. 


## What is a simulation study?

Here are some results from a Google Search:

1. A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer [@marie]
2. Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one's own research[@hallgren2013conducting]

I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. I see simulations in the following way^[All flowcharts are created using the `DiagrammeR` pacakge [@R-DiagrammeR]]:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
graph LR
A((Input 1))-->B{Procedure}
D((Input 2))-->B{Procedure}
E((Input 3))-->B{Procedure}
B-->C[Output 1]
B-->F[Output 1]
B-->G[Output 1]
")
```

There are three crucial components to any simulation study: 

1. **Procedure** - something that doesn't change throughout the simulation study
2. **Input**: _several_ values of the same quantity that are passed to the procedure. 
3. **Output**: result from the procedure being applied to the inputs. Should be equal in length to the number of outputs. The following toy example illustrates this point:

```{r, echo=-1}
set.seed(123)
f_sample_median <- function(true_mean) {
  x <- rnorm(20, mean = true_mean, sd = 1)
  median(x)
}

(means <- c(1,2,3))

(sample_medians <- sapply(means, f_sample_median))
```

So here, `f_sample_median` is the procedure that generates 20 random numbers from a normal distribution with standard deviation 1 and a user specified mean, and outputs the sample median. `means` is the input vector of user specified means, and `sample_medians` is the output:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
graph LR
A((1))-->B{f_sample_median}
D((2))-->B
E((3))-->B
B-->C[1.12]
B-->F[1.86]
B-->G[2.96]
")
```


Using this very general definition of the word _simulation_, I see the following analysis techinques as a type of simulation. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
graph TB
sq[Simulation] --> ci[Bootstrap]
sq --> A[Cross Validation]
sq --> B[Sensitivity Analysis]
sq --> C[Permutations]
classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
class sq green
")
```

Boostrap, Cross Validation, Sensitivity analysis and Permutations are all similar in that they have multiple inputs with an equal number of outputs, with a fixed procedure. What differentiates them is the context in which they can be applied. The technique you choose depends entirely on the question you're trying to answer. 

## Why conduct a simulation study?

The most common applications of simulation studies are the following

### Understanding the behaviour of a statistical quantity


#### Example 1: The Central Limit Theorem

The [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) is one of the most famous theorems in statistics. This theorem basically states that the sum or mean of independent random variables (with finite mean and variance) will converge to a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the random variables. The following figure clearly illustrates this point [@joseph]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clt.png")
```

In this example, the statistical quantity of interest is the sum of the random variables. We want to verify that the sum of the time it takes to get to Purvis hall follows a normal distribution. Of course the CLT can be proven mathematically, but we can also simulate random numbers from different distributions in `R` to numerically verify this result:

```{r}
# number of random numbers to generate from each distribution
n <- 1e4

# true parameters of each distribution
mean.walk <- 4 ; var.walk <- 1
mean.bus <- (4+16)/2 ; var.bus <- (16-4)^2/12
mean.ride <- 8 ; var.ride <- 8 
mean.climb <- 6*0.5 ; var.climb <- 6*0.5^2
mean.fall <- 1/4 ; var.fall <- 1/4^2

# generate random samples from each distribution
walk <- rnorm(n, mean.walk, var.walk)
bus <- runif(n, 4, 16)
ride <- rpois(n, mean.ride)
climb <- rgamma(n, shape = 6, scale = 0.5)
fall <- rexp(n, rate = 1/mean.fall)

# true mean and variance of sum
mean.sum <- mean.walk+mean.bus+mean.ride+mean.climb+mean.fall
var.sum <- var.walk+var.bus+var.ride+var.climb+var.fall

# create a data frame of the data and calculate the sum for each sample
DT <- data.frame(walk, bus, ride, climb, fall)
DT$sum <- apply(DT,1,sum)

# plot each histogram and superimpose theoretical 
# distribution to empirical one
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
hist(walk, main="Normal(mean=4,sd=1)", freq=FALSE)
hist(bus, main="Uniform(a=4,b=16)", freq=FALSE)
hist(ride, main="Poisson(lambda=8)", freq=FALSE)
hist(climb, main="Gamma(shape=6, scale=0.5)", freq=FALSE)
hist(fall, main="Exponential(rate=4)", freq=FALSE)
hist(DT$sum, xlab='Total time', main=paste("Distribution of Sum, n = ",n), freq=FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x,mean=mean.sum,sd=sqrt(var.sum)),0,50,add=TRUE,lwd=2,col="red")
```

#### Example 2: Power Calculation

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pwr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r data, echo=FALSE}
ptab <- cbind(NULL, NULL)       # initalize ptab

for (i in seq(0,1, length.out = 200)){
  pwrt1 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 28, n2 = 1406, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  pwrt2 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 144, n2 = 1290, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  pwrt3 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 287, n2 = 1147, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  pwrt4 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 430, n2 = 1004, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  pwrt5 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 574, n2 = 860, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  pwrt6 <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 717, n2 = 717, sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL, d = i, alternative="two.sided")
  ptab <- rbind(ptab, cbind(pwrt1$d, pwrt1$power,
                            pwrt2$d, pwrt2$power,
                            pwrt3$d, pwrt3$power,
                            pwrt4$d, pwrt4$power,
                            pwrt5$d, pwrt5$power,
                            pwrt6$d, pwrt6$power))
}

ptab <- cbind(seq_len(nrow(ptab)), ptab)

colnames(ptab) <- c("id","n1=28, n2=1406.effect size","n1=28, n2=1406.power",
                    "n1=144, n2=1290.effect size","n1=144, n2=1290.power",
                    "n1=287, n2=1147.effect size","n1=287, n2=1147.power",
                    "n1=430, n2=1004.effect size","n1=430, n2=1004.power",
                    "n1=574, n2=860.effect size","n1=574, n2=860.power",
                    "n1=717, n2=717.effect size","n1=717, n2=717.power")


temp <- ptab %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  gather(key = name, value = val, 2:13) %>%
  separate(col = name, into = c("group", "var"), sep = "\\.") %>%
  spread(key = var, value = val)


temp$group <- factor(temp$group, levels = c("n1=28, n2=1406", "n1=144, n2=1290", "n1=287, n2=1147", "n1=430, n2=1004",
                                       "n1=574, n2=860", "n1=717, n2=717"))
```


When performing [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) to compare difference in means between two group, it is a useful exercise to determine the effect of unequal sample sizes in the comparison groups on **power**. Large imbalances generally will not have adequate statistical power to detect even large effect sizes associated with a factor, leading to a high Type II error rate as shown in the figure below:

```{r echo=FALSE, opts.label='fig.full'}
p <- ggplot(temp, aes(x = `effect size`, y = power, color = group))
p + geom_line(size=2) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom",
                                           axis.text=element_text(size=14),
                                           axis.title=element_text(size=14),
                                           legend.text=element_text(size=14)) 
```

To jusity this reasoning I performed a power analysis for different group sizes. I considered the following group sizes:

1. n1 = 28, n2 = 1406: n1 represents 2% of the entire sample size of 1434
2. n1 = 144, n2 = 1290: n1 represents 10% of the entire sample size of 1434
3. n1 = 287, n2 = 1147: n1 represents 20% of the entire sample size of 1434
4. n1 = 430, n2 = 1004: n1 represents 30% of the entire sample size of 1434
5. n1 = 574, n2 = 860: n1 represents 40% of the entire sample size of 1434
6. n1 = 717, n2 = 717: equal size groups (this is optimal because it leads to the highest power for a given effect size)

In the figure above we plotted the power curves for the $t$-test, as a function of the effect size, assuming a Type I error rate of 5%. 

Here is the code used to produce the above plot

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(pwr) # for power calcs
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation
library(tidyr) # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # for plotting power curves

The word simulation gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting.  3.1 What is a simulation study? Here are some results from a Google Search:  A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer (Davidian 2005) Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one’s own research(Hallgren 2013)  I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. I see simulations in the following way:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((Input 1))-->B{Procedure}\\nD((Input 2))-->B{Procedure}\\nE((Input 3))-->B{Procedure}\\nB-->C[Output 1]\\nB-->F[Output 1]\\nB-->G[Output 1]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} In words, you have a fixed procedure that takes several different inputs and produces an equal number of outputs. The following toy example illustrates this point: f_sample_median &lt;- function(true_mean) {   x &lt;- rnorm(20, mean = true_mean)   median(x) }  (means &lt;- c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 (sample_medians &lt;- sapply(means, f_sample_median)) ## [1] 1.119985 1.860057 2.964291 So here, f_sample_median is the procedure, means is the input, and sample_medians is the output:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((1))-->B{f_sample_median}\\nD((2))-->B\\nE((3))-->B\\nB-->C[1.12]\\nB-->F[1.86]\\nB-->G[2.96]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}   "]

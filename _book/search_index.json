The word simulation gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting.  3.1 What is a simulation study? Here are some results from a Google Search:  A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer (Davidian 2005) Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one’s own research(Hallgren 2013)  I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. I see simulations in the following way1:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((Input 1))-->B{Procedure}\\nD((Input 2))-->B{Procedure}\\nE((Input 3))-->B{Procedure}\\nB-->C[Output 1]\\nB-->F[Output 1]\\nB-->G[Output 1]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} There are three crucial components to any simulation study:  Procedure - something that doesn’t change throughout the simulation study Input: several values of the same quantity that are passed to the procedure. Output: result from the procedure being applied to the inputs. Should be equal in length to the number of outputs. The following toy example illustrates this point:  f_sample_median &lt;- function(true_mean) {   x &lt;- rnorm(20, mean = true_mean, sd = 1)   median(x) }  (means &lt;- c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 (sample_medians &lt;- sapply(means, f_sample_median)) ## [1] 1.119985 1.860057 2.964291 So here, f_sample_median is the procedure that generates 20 random numbers from a normal distribution with standard deviation 1 and a user specified mean, and outputs the sample median. means is the input vector of user specified means, and sample_medians is the output:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((1))-->B{f_sample_median}\\nD((2))-->B\\nE((3))-->B\\nB-->C[1.12]\\nB-->F[1.86]\\nB-->G[2.96]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Using this very general definition of the word simulation, I see the following analysis techinques as a type of simulation.  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph TB\\nsq[Simulation] --> ci[Bootstrap]\\nsq --> A[Cross Validation]\\nsq --> B[Sensitivity Analysis]\\nsq --> C[Permutations]\\nclassDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\\nclassDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\\nclass sq green\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Boostrap, Cross Validation, Sensitivity analysis and Permutations are all similar in that they have multiple inputs with an equal number of outputs, with a fixed procedure. What differentiates them is the context in which they can be applied. The technique you choose depends entirely on the question you’re trying to answer.   3.2 Why conduct a simulation study? The most common applications of simulation studies are the following  3.2.1 Understanding the behaviour of a statistical quantity  3.2.1.1 Example 1: The Central Limit Theorem The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most famous theorems in statistics. This theorem basically states that the sum or mean of independent random variables (with finite mean and variance) will converge to a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the random variables. The following figure clearly illustrates this point (Joseph 2010)  In this example, the statistical quantity of interest is the sum of the random variables. We want to verify that the sum of the time it takes to get to Purvis hall follows a normal distribution. Of course the CLT can be proven mathematically, but we can also simulate random numbers from different distributions in R to numerically verify this result: # number of random numbers to generate from each distribution n &lt;- 1e4  # true parameters of each distribution mean.walk &lt;- 4 ; var.walk &lt;- 1 mean.bus &lt;- (4+16)/2 ; var.bus &lt;- (16-4)^2/12 mean.ride &lt;- 8 ; var.ride &lt;- 8  mean.climb &lt;- 6*0.5 ; var.climb &lt;- 6*0.5^2 mean.fall &lt;- 1/4 ; var.fall &lt;- 1/4^2  # generate random samples from each distribution walk &lt;- rnorm(n, mean.walk, var.walk) bus &lt;- runif(n, 4, 16) ride &lt;- rpois(n, mean.ride) climb &lt;- rgamma(n, shape = 6, scale = 0.5) fall &lt;- rexp(n, rate = 1/mean.fall)  # true mean and variance of sum mean.sum &lt;- mean.walk+mean.bus+mean.ride+mean.climb+mean.fall var.sum &lt;- var.walk+var.bus+var.ride+var.climb+var.fall  # create a data frame of the data and calculate the sum for each sample DT &lt;- data.frame(walk, bus, ride, climb, fall) DT$sum &lt;- apply(DT,1,sum)  # plot each histogram and superimpose theoretical  # distribution to empirical one par(mfrow=c(2,3)) hist(walk, main=&quot;Normal(mean=4,sd=1)&quot;, freq=FALSE) hist(bus, main=&quot;Uniform(a=4,b=16)&quot;, freq=FALSE) hist(ride, main=&quot;Poisson(lambda=8)&quot;, freq=FALSE) hist(climb, main=&quot;Gamma(shape=6, scale=0.5)&quot;, freq=FALSE) hist(fall, main=&quot;Exponential(rate=4)&quot;, freq=FALSE) hist(DT$sum, xlab=&#39;Total time&#39;, main=paste(&quot;Distribution of Sum, n = &quot;,n), freq=FALSE) curve(dnorm(x,mean=mean.sum,sd=sqrt(var.sum)),0,50,add=TRUE,lwd=2,col=&quot;red&quot;)    3.2.1.2 Example 2: Power Calculation When performing Student’s t-test to compare difference in means between two group, it is a useful exercise to determine the effect of unequal sample sizes in the comparison groups on power. Large imbalances generally will not have adequate statistical power to detect even large effect sizes associated with a factor, leading to a high Type II error rate as shown in the figure below:  To jusity this reasoning I performed a power analysis for different group sizes. I considered the following group sizes:  n1 = 28, n2 = 1406: n1 represents 2% of the entire sample size of 1434 n1 = 144, n2 = 1290: n1 represents 10% of the entire sample size of 1434 n1 = 287, n2 = 1147: n1 represents 20% of the entire sample size of 1434 n1 = 430, n2 = 1004: n1 represents 30% of the entire sample size of 1434 n1 = 574, n2 = 860: n1 represents 40% of the entire sample size of 1434 n1 = 717, n2 = 717: equal size groups (this is optimal because it leads to the highest power for a given effect size)  In the figure above we plotted the power curves for the \\(t\\)-test, as a function of the effect size, assuming a Type I error rate of 5%.

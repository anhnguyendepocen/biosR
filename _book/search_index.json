The word simulation gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting.  3.1 What is a simulation study? Here are some results from a Google Search:  A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer (Davidian 2005) Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one’s own research(Hallgren 2013)  I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. Figure 3.1 describes the way I see simulations.

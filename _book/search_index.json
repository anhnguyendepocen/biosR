The word simulation gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting.  3.1 What is a simulation study? Here are some results from a Google Search:  A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer (Davidian 2005) Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one’s own research(Hallgren 2013)  I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. I see simulations in the following way1:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((Input 1))-->B{Procedure}\\nD((Input 2))-->B{Procedure}\\nE((Input 3))-->B{Procedure}\\nB-->C[Output 1]\\nB-->F[Output 1]\\nB-->G[Output 1]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} There are three crucial components to any simulation study:  Procedure - something that doesn’t change throughout the simulation study Input: several values of the same quantity that are passed to the procedure. Output: result from the procedure being applied to the inputs. Should be equal in length to the number of outputs. The following toy example illustrates this point:  f_sample_median &lt;- function(true_mean) {   x &lt;- rnorm(20, mean = true_mean, sd = 1)   median(x) }  (means &lt;- c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 (sample_medians &lt;- sapply(means, f_sample_median)) ## [1] 1.119985 1.860057 2.964291 So here, f_sample_median is the procedure that generates 20 random numbers from a normal distribution with standard deviation 1 and a user specified mean, and outputs the sample median. means is the input vector of user specified means, and sample_medians is the output:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((1))-->B{f_sample_median}\\nD((2))-->B\\nE((3))-->B\\nB-->C[1.12]\\nB-->F[1.86]\\nB-->G[2.96]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Using this very general definition of the word simulation, I see the following analysis techinques as a type of simulation.  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph TB\\nsq[Simulation] --> ci[Bootstrap]\\nsq --> A[Cross Validation]\\nsq --> B[Sensitivity Analysis]\\nsq --> C[Permutations]\\nclassDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\\nclassDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\\nclass sq orange\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}   "]

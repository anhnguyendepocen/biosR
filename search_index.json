You also need a recent version of RStudio, which is a software application that facilitates how you interact with R. It is developed by data enthusiasts who consider statistics to be more than just simulations, formulas and proofs. RStudio emphasizes the following:  Version control: Why I should use version control especially for the solo data analyst. Reproducible research: seamless integration with RMarkdown for creating dynamic documents and presentations Creating R Packages: seamless integration with the devtools package for creating software that implements your statistical method or analysis.    1.2 R Packages The following packages will be called upon at some point, so please install them before getting started with the tutorials. Enter the following command in R: install.packages(c(&quot;data.table&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;purrr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;))   1.3 Background Reading The greatest thing about R is that there are so many people out there willing to help you. R users are constantly writing tutorials and creating packages to make your analysis tasks easier. Here is a very targeted list that I suggest reading prior to starting the tutorials  Writing Functions For loops    "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1)) plot(pressure, type = &quot;b&quot;, pch = 19)    Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!   Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable(   head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;,   booktabs = TRUE )  Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

["simulations.html", "Chapter 3 Simulations 3.1 What is a simulation study?", " Chapter 3 Simulations In this chapter you’ll learn how to conduct a simulation study. The word simulation gets thrown around alot as a trivial concept, though I have found that this term is often either misused by epidemiologists or abused by statisticians. A source of this confusion arises from the fact that it is not well defined. This is not by accident. A simulation study has so many moving parts that it would be impossible to characterize in a single word. However, there are some common underlying themes behind simulation studies. For this reason, the main focus here will be on creating a general roadmap for conducting these types of analyses, that can be applied to your specific setting.  3.1 What is a simulation study? Here are some results from a Google Search:  A numerical technique for conducting experiments on the computer (Davidian 2005) Simulations provide a powerful technique for answering a broad set of methodological and theoretical questions and provide a flexible framework to answer specific questions relevant to one’s own research(Hallgren 2013)  I prefer the second definition because it speaks to the generality of simulations. I see simulations in the following way:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((Input 1))-->B{Procedure}\\nD((Input 2))-->B{Procedure}\\nE((Input 3))-->B{Procedure}\\nB-->C[Output 1]\\nB-->F[Output 1]\\nB-->G[Output 1]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} In words, you have a fixed procedure that takes several different inputs and produces an equal number of outputs. The following toy example illustrates this point: f_sample_median &lt;- function(true_mean) {     x &lt;- rnorm(20, mean = true_mean)     median(x) }  (means &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 (sample_medians &lt;- sapply(means, f_sample_median)) ## [1] 1.119985 1.860057 2.964291 So here, f_sample_median is the procedure, means is the input, and sample_medians is the output:  {\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\nA((1))-->B{f_sample_median}\\nD((2))-->B\\nE((3))-->B\\nB-->C[1.12]\\nB-->F[1.86]\\nB-->G[2.96]\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}   "],
